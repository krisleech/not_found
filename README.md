Allows you to rescue `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` for a specific model.

For example if you have a `User` model you can rescue `User::RecordNotFound`.

Code which rescue `ActiveRecord::Record` will still work as expected.

##Â Why?

Because a rescue block around code which rescues `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound`
might work as expected today, but some time in the future when within that
block another model ends up raising `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` it leads to
unexpected behaviour which is diffcult to trace. This gem allows you to be
explicit about what you want to rescue.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'not_found'
```

## Usage

Include the mixin for a single model

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include NotFound::Mixin
end
```

or every model

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.class_eval { include NotFound::Mixin }
```

and rescue away like this

```ruby
begin
  user = User.find(id)
rescue User::RecordNotFound
  # handle missing user
end
```

or this

```ruby
begin
  user = User.find(id)
  post = Post.find(id)
rescue User::RecordNotFound
  # handle missing user
rescue Post::RecordNotFound
  # handle missing post
end
```

or this

```ruby
begin
  user = User.find(id)
  post = Post.find(id)
rescue User::RecordNotFound
  # handle missing user
rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
  # handle missing posts and other models
end
```
